An admin panel, also known as an administration or backend panel, is a web-based interface designed to facilitate the management and control of a website, web application, or system. It provides authorized users, typically administrators or other privileged users, with a centralized platform to perform various tasks related to the configuration, monitoring, and maintenance of the underlying system.
